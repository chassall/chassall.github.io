title: The Sparsity Bias

While completing my master's degree in experimental psychology at Dalhousie University my supervisor and I formed a reading group with Dr. Thomas Trappenberg and his PhD student, Patrick Connor, both from the Faculty of Computer Science. Our common interest was in computational models of learning - specifically, reinforcement learning (RL). One of the papers we discussed - a Cognitive Science Society conference paper presented by Gershman, Cohen, and Niv (2010) - resonated with us because it focused on a challenge that both humans and artificial systems face: How is RL possible in a multidimensional world?

The answer, according to Gershman et al. (2010), is *sparsity*. By forming hypotheses about which dimensions are relevant, humans are able to accelerate their learning beyond what a simple RL model would predict. To examine the neural correlates of the sparsity bias, we measured RL prediction errors and attentional signals via EEG. Both signals behaved as predicted by a hybrid RL model (an RL model with an attentional bias).

The interdisciplinary nature of this paper made it fun but challenging to write. Publishing it also proved difficult, and the paper was initially rejected three times (albeit with increasingly "positive" rejections). Part of our issue was a lack of expertise in the attention domain, so we recruited one of the best - Dr. John McDonald - to the team. With John's contributions, our arguments relating RL and attentional systems were strengthened (not to mention the contributions of several anonymous reviewers).
