![DiVA performance](/images/diva.png)

Between 2009 and 2011, I received two NSERC-USRAs (undergraduate research awards) to work on a gesture-controlled speech synthesis system called [DiVA](http://www.magic.ubc.ca/2014/11/21/divas/) (Digital Vetriloquized Actor). During that time, I translated existing DiVA control software from Max/MSP to C++ and developed additional interface features. The result was more robust, faster, easier to debug, and more flexible. ([poster](/posters/Hassall2011DIVAPoster.pdf))
I also explored different gesture paradigms for vowel control ([poster](/posters/ASAvowelSpacePoster.pdf)).

Check out the [Macleans article](https://www.macleans.ca/culture/nice-voice-for-a-glove/).

The DiVA project included a successful video shoot: ([small](http://debussy.music.ubc.ca/pritchard/BodyKnow.html)) ([large](http://debussy.music.ubc.ca/pritchard/BodyMP4Large.html)).

What did I learn?
===
* Undergraduate research is an invaluable experience
* Developing real-world software is challenging
* Having good software engineering practices is important
