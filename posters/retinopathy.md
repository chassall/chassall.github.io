## Introduction ##

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. It is currently diagnosed via the examination of retinal photographs, a difficult and error-prone process. Here we sought to (a) improve medical education regarding the training of retinopathy diagnosis, and (b) enhance our understanding of the neural correlates of perceptual decision making.

## Methods ##

We recorded electroencephalography while undergraduate volunteers completed a similarity judgement task. Participants were asked to select which of ten randomly-chosen reference retinas most closely resembled a centrally-presented query retina. Feedback was given following each choice to indicate whether the chosen retina matched the query retina in terms of disease severity. Each “diagnosis” continued until a matching retina was chosen.

## Results ##

Consistent with previous decision-making literature, we were able to characterize two decision types. Automatic Type 1 (or System 1) decisions were fast and occurred earlier in a diagnosis attempt. Deliberative Type 2 (or System 2) decisions were slow and occurred later in a diagnosis attempt, i.e. after several incorrect guesses. Importantly, we observed enhanced frontal midline theta, a neural indicator of enhanced cognitive control, during Type 2 decisions relative to Type 1 decisions. Interestingly, less frontal midline theta was observed if ideal reference images were used instead of random reference images, suggesting the possibility of manipulating which mode of decision making is engaged during medical diagnosis.
