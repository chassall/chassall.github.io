I'm a PhD candidate in the interdisciplinary program at the University of Victoria in Victoria, BC. I have an MSc in [Experimental Psychology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience.html) from Dalhousie University, and undergraduate degrees in [Mathematical Physics](https://www.ualberta.ca/physics/) (University of Alberta) and [Cognitive Systems](https://cogsys.ubc.ca/) (University of British Columbia).

I am co-supervised by [Olav Krigolson](http://www.olavkrigolson.com/) and [Clay Holroyd](https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/people/faculty-directory/holroydclay.php). Most of the time, I can be found in [The Theoretical and Applied Neuroscience Laboratory](http://www.tanlab.ca/) at the University of Victoria.

My research interests include:
* Computational Neuroscience
* Reinforcement Learning
* Neuroimaging
* Decision Making
