I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Laboratory](https://www.huntlab.co.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Laurence Hunt](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/people/laurence-hunt). I use neuroimaging and computational modelling to study how we make decisions.
