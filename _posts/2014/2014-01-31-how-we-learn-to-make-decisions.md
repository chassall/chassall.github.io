In the summer of 2008 I took an undergraduate cognitive neuroscience class taught by [Olav Krigolson](https://www.olavkrigolson.com), then a post-doctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia. I was amazed to learn that our decisions are underpinned by computations that are implemented in the brain. After chatting with Olav on the bus one day, we started working our way through the exercises in [*Reinforcement Learning*](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto. Our small-but-mighty modelling club next tackled experimental data collected by Olav in the [Attentional Neuroscience Lab](https://attention.psych.ubc.ca/). This work formed the basis of my undergraduate honours project, and contributed to my decision to attend graduate school in Experimental Psychology at Dalhousie University (with Olav as my supervisor).

I also fortunate to have my modelling work included in a Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience paper:

Krigolson, O. E., Hassall, C. D., & Handy, T. C. (2013). How We Learn to Make Decisions: Rapid Propagation of Reinforcement Learning Prediction Errors in Humans. _Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience_, _26_(3), 635â€“644. [https://doi.org/10/gd32z4](https://doi.org/10/gd32z4 "https://doi.org/10/gd32z4")

The main idea of the paper is that humans learn via a computational process called reinforcement learning (RL). According to RL, rewarded actions tend to be repeated - a process that can happen very quickly in humans. Here, participants learned which of two slot machines yield a reward. Initially, reward was unexpected, and thus elicited a *prediction error* - a difference in value between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome. This neural learning signal diminished for subsequent rewards. Our critical finding was that predictive cues - which preceded both actions and outcomes - also elicited prediction errors, but only after learning had occurred. This observation is consistent with single-cell recordings in monkeys, e.g. Schultz, Dayan, & Montague, 1997. Finally, we showed that prediction errors to rewards and cues change over time as predicted by a computational model.
