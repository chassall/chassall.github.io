![A few musical and tech-looking things](/images/subclassbanner.jpg)
In 2010 I took part in a new seminar offered through the UBC School of Music and directed by Bob Pritchard, Keith Hamel, and Nicolas d'Alessandro called [SUBCLASS](https://ubcsubclass2016.wordpress.com/) (Sonic UBC Laptop Sounds and Sensors). SUBCLASS is UBC's *laptop orchestra*. What is a laptop orchestra? In the words of Dr. Bob:

>We create software and hardware to track gestures of musicians and dancers, and use the resulting data to control audio and video processing in performance.

Our work led to two performances, held at the UBC Recital Hall:

I'm Nobody, written and performed by Keith Hamel, Cameron Hassall, and Farshid Samandari. November 19, 2010, UBC Recital Hall. ([video](https://vimeo.com/17662796))

ChromaHack, written and performed by David Dorrington, Martin Ritter, Johnty Wang, Bob Pritchard. November 19, 2010, UBC Recital Hall. ([video](https://vimeo.com/17661872))

What did I learn?
---
* Coming up with a new musical interface is hard
* Performance is challenging but fun
* Engineers can learn music and musicians can learn engineering
