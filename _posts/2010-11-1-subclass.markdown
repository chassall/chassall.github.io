title: "SUBC:LASS"

## SUBCLASS is UBC's laptop orchestra.

This is a music seminar I took part in at UBC in 2010-2011, the first year it was offered.

Basically, we used fancy or not-so-fancy computer programs and fancy or not-so-fancy controllers to make music. We could have done this at home, alone, and it would still have been cool. But we did it together, on stage, and the results were amazing, surprising, sometimes confusing, but always musical.

In 2010-2011, SUBC:LASS was directed by Bob Pritchard, Keith Hamel, and Nicolas d'Alessandro.

MUSC 403C Course Description

This ensemble will concentrate on performances that require performers to use gesture to translate motion into sound, through the use of accelerometers, MIDI controllers, web cams, tablets, etc. Other instruments (such as Theremins, circuit-bent electronics, or traditional instruments) may be added depending upon the piece being performed. Each member of SUBCLASS will have the opportunity to perform, compose and/or direct compositions which will range from small chamber works to networked performance environments. Each member is expected to participate in a minimum of two public performances each semester and to assist the entire group in technical support in classes, rehearsals and performances.
